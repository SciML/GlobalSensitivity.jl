abstract = {Uncertainty in parameters is present in many risk assessment problems and leads to uncertainty in model predictions. In this work, we introduce a global sensitivity indicator which looks at the influence of input uncertainty on the entire output distribution without reference to a specific moment of the output (moment independence) and which can be defined also in the presence of correlations among the parameters. We discuss its mathematical properties and highlight the differences between the present indicator, variance-based uncertainty importance measures and a moment independent sensitivity indicator previously introduced in the literature. Numerical results are discussed with application to the probabilistic risk assessment model on which Iman [A matrix-based approach to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for fault trees.

@article{Campolongo2007,
abstract = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Morris1991,
abstract = {A computational model is a representation of some physical or other system of interest, first expressed mathematically and then implemented in the form of a computer program; it may be viewed as a function of inputs that, when evaluated, produces outputs. Motivation for this article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

abstract = {This paper deals with computations of sensitivity indices in sensitivity analysis. Given a mathematical or computational model y =f(x1,x2,...,xk), where the input factors xi 's are uncorrelated with one another, one can see y as the realization of a stochastic process obtained by sampling each of the xi from its marginal distribution. The sensitivity indices are related to the decomposition of the variance of y into terms either due to each xi taken singularly (first order indices), as well as into terms due to the cooperative effects of more than one xi . In this paper we assume that one has computed the full set of first order sensitivity indices as well as the full set of total-order sensitivity indices (a fairly common strategy in sensitivity analysis), and show that in this case the same set of model evaluations can be used to compute double estimates of: • the total effect of two factors taken together, for all such (k,2) couples, where k is the dimentionality of the model; • the total effect of k−2 factors taken together, for all (k,2) such (k−2) couples. We further introduce a new strategy for the computation of the full sets of first plus total order sensitivity indices that is about 50{\%} cheaper in terms of model evaluations with respect to previously published works. We discuss separately the case where the input factors xi's are not independent from each other.},

@article{Saltelli1995,
abstract = {The present article is a sequel to an earlier study in this journal (Saltelli et al., 1993) where two new sensitivity analysis techniques were presented. Those techniques, the modified Hora and Iman importance measure (HIM*) (Hora and Iman, 1986; Iman and Hora 1990; Ishigami and Homma, 1989, 1990) and the iterated fractional factorial design (IFFD) (Andres, 1987; Andres and Hajas, 1993) were proposed in order to overcome limitations in existing methods (Saltelli and Homma, 1992). Sensitivity analysis (SA) of model output investigates how the predictions of a model are related to its input parameters. In particular, Monte Carlo-based SA attempts to explain the uncertainly in model output by apportioning the total output uncertainty to the uncertainties of individual input parameters. It was pointed out in Saltelli and Homma (1992) that techniques employed in the existing literature were affected by severe limitations in the presence of nonmonotonic relationships between input and output. The search for better SA methods was pursued with reference to their “reproducibility” and “accuracy”. The former is a measure of how well SA predictions are replicated when repeating the analysis on independent samples taken from the same input parameter space. The latter deals with the correctness of the SA results. The present note continues and completes the analysis of the performance of IFFD with respect to the two requirements. IFFD was found to generate highly reproducible results for sufficiently large sample sizes. It exceeded the capability of linear methods by detecting quadratic effects in the relationship between input parameters and model predictions, but had difficulty in dealing with higher order effects.},

The results show that the three methods provide consistent para- meter importance rankings in this system.

It is an approach for quantitative, variance-based, sensitivity analysis of mathematical models used for design purposes. The method is based on the subdivision of the global variance into its components, due to the design-factor contributions, using general polynomial regression models. The performance of the RBSA is compared to other methods commonly used in engineering for computing sensitivity, namely, the method of Sobol{\textquoteright}, the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, the method of Morris, and the standardized regression coefficients. It was found that RBSA, under certain circumstances, provides very accurate results with a significant reduction of the number of required model evaluations. A test case, using the mathematical models of two subsystems of a spacecraft, demonstrates how RBSA facilitates the discovery and understanding of the effects of the design choices on the performance of the system.",

    abstract = { Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: \beginlist \item High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. \item One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. \item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. \endlist We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience. }

abstract = {Models are increasingly being relied upon to inform and support natural resource management. They are incorporating an ever broader range of disciplines and now often confront people without strong quantitative or model-building backgrounds. These trends imply a need for wider awareness of what constitutes good model-development practice, including reporting of models to users and sceptical review of models by users. To this end the paper outlines ten basic steps of good, disciplined model practice. The aim is to develop purposeful, credible models from data and prior knowledge, in consort with end-users, with every stage open to critical review and revision. Best practice entails identifying clearly the clients and objectives of the modelling exercise; documenting the nature (quantity, quality, limitations) of the data used to construct and test the model; providing a strong rationale for the choice of model family and features (encompassing review of alternative approaches); justifying the techniques used to calibrate the model; serious analysis, testing and discussion of model performance; and making a resultant statement of model assumptions, utility, accuracy, limitations, and scope for improvement. In natural resource management applications, these steps will be a learning process, even a partnership, between model developers, clients and other interested parties.}
